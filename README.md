Monorepo managed by pnpm with:
- `client`: React + Vite frontend.
- `engine`: Express + TypeScript backend.

Useful commands (run from repo root):
- `pnpm install` to install all workspace deps.
- `pnpm dev:client` to start the Vite dev server.
- `pnpm dev:engine` to start the Express dev server.
- `pnpm build` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm lint` to run tasks across packages.
